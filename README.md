# Renewable Energy Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Renewable Energy Dashboard is a capstone project completed as part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Toledo. This project tracks and monitors multiple renewable energy sources – including solar, wind, and hydro – through a user-friendly dashboard. Users can visualize real-time and historical energy data to better manage and analyze their renewable energy systems at home.
